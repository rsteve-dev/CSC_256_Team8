#### 3. Download WebDriver

Each browser requires a separate driver and needs to be downloadesd separately
for instance :

+ Chrome:<https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/>
+ Firefox: <https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases>
+ Safari: Safari driver come swith the macOS
+ Edge: <https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/>
  
__For windows__

```
Extract the downloaded driver and place it in a location of your choice
Add the path to the driver in your system's PATH variable. This ensures Python can access and use the driver.
```

__For Linux__

```
Move the downloaded driver to /usr/local/bin or any directory in your PATH 
Ensure proper permissions are granted to the driver (use chmod +x ) 
```
#### 4. verify the installation by writing and running the following script
```
 # Python script to verify Selenium installation 
from selenium import webdriver

# Specify the path to chromedriver
driver = webdriver.Chrome('http://127.0.0.1:5000')

#  Open a website 
driver.get('http://www.google.com')

# Close the browser
driver.quit()

```

# 4. Test Driven Development (TDD) Lab Guide
### What is TDD?
Test Driven Development (TDD) is a testing methodology that requires test cases to be written before any actual development of the code begins. This ensures that any code written adheres to and passes the test cases, which in turn produces solid, high-quality code with minimal bugs. TDD promotes frequent feedback as well, through the development of small sections of test cases and code together, which helps by immediately outlining which areas of the code need to be fixed instead of waiting for the entire code to be completed before the testing process begins.

TDD development is broken up into three categories, each which follows one main rule:
- **Red Phase:** Write a failing unit test for the functionality to be implemented.
- **Green Phase:** Write just enough production code to make the failing test pass.
- **Refactor Phase:** Improve upon the code written in the green phase to reduce redundancy.

### What is pytest?
Pytest is a commonly used testing framework in Python, and is widely popular due to its comprehensive and user-friendly features. Pytest is very useful for creating simple and efficient tests that are easy to read, and streamlines the testing process through automatic detection of all test files and functions within a given project. Though based on Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles, pytest is very flexible and can be applied to other testing methodologies as well, and additionally supports unit, functional and integration testing levels.

This lab will guide you through the process of using pytest to write and execute tests on a Flask-based bookstore web application.

## Getting Started with Python, Pytest, and Required Packages
- #### Install Python:
  - Ensure Python (version 3.7 or higher) is installed on your system. If needed, download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
  - You can ensure Python is installed and check its version by opening a command line and running:
    - `python --version`
## Set Up Your Testing Environment
- #### Setting Up the Python Virtual Environment
  - Navigate to the â€˜WebAppâ€™ folder and open a command line. Initiate your Python virtual environment by running:
    - `python -m venv env`
- #### Activate Python Virtual Environment
  - Activate the virtual environment:
      - On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
      - On Unix or MacOS: `source venv/bin/activate` 
- #### Install Required Packages:
  - Open a command line interface inside of the â€˜WebAppâ€™ folder.
  - Run the requirements.txt file to install all required packages:
    - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- #### Run the Flask Application:
  - Navigate to your â€˜WebAppâ€™ folder in the command line and run:
    - `flask --debug --app main run`
  - If you receive the error â€˜flask is not a recognized commandâ€™, alternatively run:
    - `python -m flask --debug --app main run`
  - The application should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:5000/ and will respond to changes you make in the code when you refresh the page. The flask application will need to be running for the lab to interact with it.

- - -

## Writing Pytest Tests
- #### Open Your Test File:
  - In your project folder, open the file named `test_main.py`.
  - This file will contain all your pytest tests.

- #### Basic Pytest Test Structure
  - ##### Assertions
    - An assertion is a check that the code makes when running to verify if the provided condition is true. The test passes if the provided condition is validated, and fails if it does not meet the assertion requirements.
    - The syntax of an assertion statement is:
      - `assert expression, message`
    - Where `expression` is the condition to check, and `message` is an optional error message in the event the test fails.
  - ##### Fixtures
    - A fixture is a mechanism that is established as a baseline in order to set up the testing environment or required data. In pytest, a fixture is a Python function that provides the necessary test data or other resources to test functions that require them.
    - A fixture in pytest is formatted as:
      - ```
        @pytest.fixture
        def function():
          # Function information goes here
  - ##### Parametrizing
    - Parametrizing allows the test function to run multiple times with different provided sets of data, which eliminates the need to write multiple tests to check for various situations.
    - Parametrizing tests in pytest is formatted as:
    - ```
      @pytest.mark.parametrize("string",[(value1)(value2)])
      def function(string):
        # Function information goes here
    - Where `string` is the name of the argument the function will take, and `value1` and `value2` are a list of tuples, with each representing a different test case and containing a set of values for the argument. There can be multiple arguments and multiple tuples.
  - ##### pytest.raises
    - pytest.raises checks that certain exceptions get raised when appropriate. The test passes if the exception is raised, otherwise the test fails.

- - -

## Test Examples
- #### Test 1 - Adding a New Book
  - This test validates that a new book can be successfully added.
  - 
- #### Test 2 - Error Handling
  - This test validates if an exception is raised when a user attempts to add a new book with empty inputs.
  - 

## Incomplete Test Scenarios
- #### Test 3 (Incomplete) - Getting CSV Data
  - Write a test that verifies that the data from the CSV file can be successfully loaded.
  - Instruction: Follow the three phases/rules of TDD when writing the test & include screenshots of each phase.
- #### Test 4 (Incomplete) - Writing CSV Data
  - Write a test that verifies that the CSV file can successfully write data.
  - Instruction: Follow the three phases/rules of TDD when writing the test & include screenshots of each phase.

- - -

## Expected Test Results
- #### Test 1
  - In the "Adding a New Book" test, the new book title should be present in the page content after submission.
- #### Test 2
  - For the "Error Handling" test, an exception should be raised when attempting to submit a new book with empty inputs.
- #### Test 3
  - Expected results will depend on the specific implementation but should generally include successful loading of the CSV file data.
- #### Test 4
  - Expected results will depend on the specific implementation but should generally include successful writing of data to the CSV file.

- - -

## Running Tests
- Execute pytest tests with the following command:
  - `python test_main.py`
- If pytest is installed correctly, a passing test will issue the following output format:
  - ```
    ======================== test session starts =====================
    â€¦
    collected 1 item
    test_main.py .                                   	[100%]
    ======================== 1 passed in 0.01s =====================

- - -

## Conclusion
- This lab should provide a good insight into the workings of pytest, how to automate testing, and the beneficial impact that something like automated web-testing can provide in a development environment. Through a mix of guided examples and interactive exercises, you will gain practical experience in testing web applications. This hands-on approach is designed to enhance your skills in both pytest and general web testing methodologies such as Test Driven Development.

# 5.  Playwrite Lab
## Playwright Lab: Testing a Bookstore Web Application
Playwright is a powerful framework for automating browsers, allowing developers to simulate user interactions with web applications. It supports multiple browsers, making it ideal for cross-browser testing. Playwright is primarily used for end-to-end testing, which tests the flow of an application from start to finish.

## Writing Playwright Tests
1. Open Your Test File
2. In your project folder, open the file named playwright_test_suite.py.
   This file will contain all your Playwright tests.
#### Basic Playwright Test Structure
A basic Playwright test structure (included) looks like this:
```
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright

def run(playwright):
    browser = playwright.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    context = browser.new_context()

    # Define your tests here

    context.close()
    browser.close()

with sync_playwright() as playwright:
    run(playwright)

```


#### Test Examples
1. Test 1 - Loading the Webpage and Checking the Title:
   This test navigates to the main page and checks if the title is as expected.
   ```
	page = context.new_page()
	page.goto("http://127.0.0.1:5000/")
	assert "County Bookstore" in page.title(), "Page title does not match"
   ```
2.  Test 2 - Adding a New Book:
This test simulates adding a new book by interacting with the web elements.
```
	page.click("text=Add Book")  # Click on the 'Add Book' button
	page.fill("input[name='title']", "New Book Title")  # Fill the title
	page.fill("input[name='author']", "Author Name")  # Fill the author
	page.click("text=Submit")  # Submit the new book
	assert "New Book Title" in page.content()  # Verification logic
```

#### Incomplete Test Scenarios (Exercises YOU need to Complete):
3. Test 3 (Incomplete) - Search Functionality:
   Write a test that searches for a book and verifies the search results.
   Instruction: Fill in the search input, click the search button, and assert that the expected result is present in the page content.
4. Test 4 (Incomplete) - Error Handling:
    Write a test for handling an error, like submitting an empty form.
      Instruction: Try submitting the 'Add Book' form without filling in any details and assert that the appropriate error message is displayed.

#### Expected Results from Testing

- Test 1: For the "Loading the Webpage" test, the page title should match "County Bookstore".
- Test 2: In the "Adding a New Book" test, the new book title should be present in the page content after submission.
- Test 3: Expected results will depend on the specific implementation but should generally include successful execution of the search.
- Test 4:  Expected results will depend on the specific implementation but should generally include proper error handling.

#### Running the Tests
Execute your tests using the command:
	` python playwright_test_suite.py `
         Observe the results to ensure all tests are functioning as expected.

## Conclusion
This lab provides a comprehensive introduction to automated web testing using Playwright. Through a mix of guided examples and interactive exercises, you will gain practical experience in testing web applications. This hands-on approach is designed to enhance your skills in both Playwright and general web testing methodologies.
