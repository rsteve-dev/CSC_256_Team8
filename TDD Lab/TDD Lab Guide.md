## Getting Started with Pytest
- #### Install Python:
  - Ensure Python (version 3.7 or higher) is installed on your system.
    - If needed, download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- #### Install Pytest:
  - Open a command line interface/terminal and install Pytest using pip:
    - `pip install pytest`
  - You can then verify if Pytest was successfully installed with the following command:
    - `pytest --version`

## Set Up Your Testing Environment
- Create a new folder on your machine for this project.
- Download the provided `main.py` file and the incomplete `test_suite_pytest.py` file. Place these in the previously created folder.

## Running Tests
- Execute Pytest tests with the following command:
  - `pytest test_suite_pytest.py`
- If Pytest is installed correctly, a passing test will issue the following output format:
  - ```
    ======================== test session starts =====================
    â€¦
